# Achroweb Solutions - AI Booking Intelligence Dashboard

## Project Overview
A stunning, futuristic glassmorphism dashboard for Achroweb Solutions that integrates with Vapi voice AI to demonstrate intelligent booking capabilities. The system provides a premium, alive-feeling interface with smooth animations, real-time updates, and natural language booking input.

**Tagline**: "Turning Conversations into Confirmations"

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- **Natural Language Booking Input**: Users can type commands like "Book for John at 4 PM tomorrow for AI Consultation" and the system intelligently parses and creates bookings
- **Vapi Voice Agent Integration**: Modal integration with Vapi demo for voice-based booking interactions
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live timestamp, booking statistics, and animated booking cards
- **Complete CRUD Operations**: Full API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting bookings
- **Sample Data**: Pre-populated with 3 sample bookings to demonstrate the system

### UI/UX Excellence
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Beautiful frosted glass effects with backdrop blur throughout
- **Dark Futuristic Theme**: Deep space backgrounds with neon-blue accents and gradient animations
- **Smooth Animations**: 
  - Pulsing AI orb and live indicators
  - Slide-in animations for new bookings
  - Gradient text effects on branding
  - Shimmer effects on glass borders
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly with adaptive layouts
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Wouter (routing), TanStack Query
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js
- **Storage**: In-memory storage (MemStorage) with sample data
- **Validation**: Zod schemas with proper type safety
- **Design System**: Custom glassmorphism utilities, neon glow effects, pulse animations

## Architecture

### Data Model
```typescript
Booking {
  id: string (UUID)
  clientName: string
  serviceType: string (AI Consultation | Automation Setup | Voice AI Demo | Custom Integration | Strategy Session)
  bookingDate: Date
  status: string (Confirmed | Rescheduled | Canceled | Pending)
  notes: string | null
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/bookings` - Fetch all bookings
- `GET /api/bookings/:id` - Fetch single booking
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create new booking
- `PATCH /api/bookings/:id` - Update existing booking
- `DELETE /api/bookings/:id` - Delete booking

### Key Components
- **Dashboard** (`client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`): Main application page
- **BookingCard** (`client/src/components/booking-card.tsx`): Individual booking display
- **StatsCard** (`client/src/components/stats-card.tsx`): Statistics dashboard
- **VapiModal** (`client/src/components/vapi-modal.tsx`): Voice agent integration dialog
- **AIOrb** (`client/src/components/ai-orb.tsx`): Animated gradient orb component
- **BookingParser** (`client/src/lib/booking-parser.ts`): Natural language processing for booking input

## Natural Language Parser Capabilities

The booking parser can understand various input formats:
- Client names: "Book for John" or "Schedule Sarah"
- Times: "at 3 PM", "at 4:30 PM", "at 2 AM"
- Dates: "tomorrow", "today", "on Friday", "on Monday", "on March 15", "on 15th"
- Services: Automatically detects keywords like "automation", "voice", "demo", "integration", "strategy"

Examples:
- "Book for Alex at 3 PM tomorrow for AI Consultation"
- "Schedule Mike on Friday at 2 PM for Automation Setup"
- "Create booking for Sarah at 4:30 PM today for Voice AI Demo"

## Design System

### Color Palette
- **Background**: Deep space dark (`220 6% 8%`)
- **Card/Glass**: Semi-transparent dark with blur (`220 6% 11% / 0.6`)
- **Primary/Neon**: Electric blue (`217 91% 28%`)
- **Success**: Vibrant cyan (`195 85% 62%`)
- **Warning**: Amber glow (`32 95% 60%`)
- **Error**: Crimson (`0 84% 50%`)

### Custom Utilities
- `.glass` - Glassmorphic card with backdrop blur
