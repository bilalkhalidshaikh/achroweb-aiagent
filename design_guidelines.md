# AI Booking System Dashboard - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Futuristic Glassmorphism Dashboard** - Drawing inspiration from cyberpunk aesthetics, Apple's design clarity, and modern AI interfaces (Linear, Vercel, Stripe dashboards). This is a premium, dark-themed dashboard that feels intelligent and alive.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Glassmorphism Excellence**: Translucent panels with backdrop blur, subtle borders, and layered depth
2. **Living Interface**: Continuous subtle animations that suggest the AI is actively working
3. **Premium Dark Aesthetic**: Deep backgrounds with strategic neon-blue accents
4. **Data Clarity**: Information hierarchy that makes booking data instantly scannable

## Typography System

**Primary Font**: Inter or SF Pro Display (Google Fonts CDN)
**Accent Font**: Orbitron or Rajdhana for futuristic headers (Google Fonts CDN)

**Hierarchy**:
- Hero Heading (H1): Futuristic font, text-5xl (3rem), font-bold, letter-spacing tight
- Dashboard Title: text-2xl, font-semibold
- Section Headers: text-lg, font-medium, uppercase tracking-wide
- Booking Card Titles: text-base, font-semibold
- Body Text/Labels: text-sm, font-normal
- Timestamps/Meta: text-xs, font-light, opacity-70

---

## Layout System

**Spacing Units**: Consistent use of Tailwind units: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24

**Grid Structure**:
- Dashboard container: max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 py-8
- Two-column layout on desktop (lg:grid-cols-2): Left = Live bookings feed, Right = Controls/stats
- Single column on mobile: Stack vertically with full-width cards
- Card spacing: gap-6 between grid items, p-6 internal padding

**Component Spacing**:
- Header: py-6 with backdrop blur sticky positioning
- Main content: py-12 from header
- Section margins: mb-12 between major sections
- Card internal: p-6 with mb-4 between elements

---

## Color Palette (No Direct Implementation)

Describe in terms of visual effect only:
- **Background**: Deep space darkness with subtle gradient
- **Glassmorphic panels**: Translucent with soft luminous borders
- **Accent glow**: Electric neon-blue for active states and highlights
- **Success indicators**: Vibrant cyan-blue for confirmed bookings
- **Warning states**: Amber glow for rescheduled items
- **Error states**: Crimson glow for cancellations
- **Text**: Crisp white primary, soft gray secondary

### 2. Hero/Command Section
- Prominent glassmorphic panel (mb-12)
- Large "AI Voice Agent" call-to-action button with gradient glow effect
- Simulation input field below: Rounded, frosted glass appearance with placeholder "Book for John at 4 PM tomorrow..."
- Submit button: Glowing neon accent with ripple animation on click

### 3. Stats Dashboard (Above Booking Feed)
- Three-column grid (grid-cols-3 gap-4) on desktop, stack on mobile
- Glassmorphic stat cards showing:
  - Total Bookings (with animated counter)
  - Confirmed Today (green pulse)
  - Pending Actions (amber pulse)
- Each card: Icon + Number (large) + Label (small)

### 4. Booking Card Component (Repeating)
- Glassmorphic container with subtle glow border
- Status indicator: Color-coded pill badge (top-right corner)
- Client name: Bold, prominent (text-lg)
- Service type: Icon + text (text-sm, uppercase, tracking-wide)

### 5. Voice Logs Tab (Optional Secondary View)
- Tabbed interface: "Live Bookings" | "Voice Logs"
- Glassmorphic tab buttons with active state glow
- Voice log entries: Transcript-style cards with microphone icon
- Timestamp + "AI Assistant: [transcript snippet]"

## Animations & Motion

### Continuous Ambient Animations
1. **Background**: Slow-moving gradient mesh or particles
2. **Glass panels**: Subtle shimmer effect on borders (2-3s loop)
3. **Active indicators**: Pulsing glow (1.5s ease-in-out infinite)
4. **Timestamp**: Fade in/out heartbeat (every 1s)

### Interaction Animations
1. **New booking appears**: Slide-in from top with scale (0.95 → 1) and opacity (0 → 1)
2. **Button clicks**: Ripple effect radiating from click point
3. **Card hover**: Lift + glow enhancement (200ms ease)
4. **Input focus**: Border glow expansion

### Loading States
- Skeleton loader: Animated gradient sweep across glassmorphic shapes
- "Processing booking..." overlay with spinning AI icon

---

## Accessibility & Interaction

- Focus states: Prominent neon outline (focus-visible)
- All buttons: Minimum 44x44px touch target
- Form inputs: Clear labels, error states with red glow
- Status indicators: Text + color coding (not color alone)
- Keyboard navigation: Tab order follows visual hierarchy

---

## Responsive Behavior

**Desktop (lg: 1024px+)**:
- Two-column grid layout
- Stats in three columns
- Maximum width 1280px centered

**Tablet (md: 768px-1023px)**:
- Single column with wider cards
- Stats remain three columns
- Reduced spacing (py-8 instead of py-12)

**Mobile (< 768px)**:
- Full single column stack
- Stats stack vertically
- Larger touch targets (increased padding)
- Simplified animations (reduce motion)

---

## Special Effects

1. **AI Orb/Pulse**: Animated SVG or CSS gradient orb in header corner, continuously pulsing
2. **Data Flow Lines**: Subtle animated lines connecting sections (optional, sparingly)
3. **Particle Field**: Ultra-subtle floating particles in background (very low opacity)
4. **Booking Confirmation**: Brief flash effect when new booking added
5. **Voice Agent Button**: Glow pulse suggesting it's "alive" and ready

## Images

**No hero image required** - This is a dashboard/application interface, not a marketing page. Focus on glassmorphic UI elements, icons, and data visualization instead.

**Icons**: Use Heroicons (outline style) via CDN for consistency - microphone, calendar, user, check-circle, clock, etc.
