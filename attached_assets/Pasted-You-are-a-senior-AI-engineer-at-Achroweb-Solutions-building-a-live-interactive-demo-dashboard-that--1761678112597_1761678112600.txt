You are a senior AI engineer at Achroweb Solutions, building a live interactive demo dashboard that connects to the following Vapi voice agent:
🔗 https://vapi.ai?demo=true&shareKey=738a9d89-3707-4f15-b1bd-836557d10561&assistantId=8c95d084-15b5-4593-a770-bc1091b2d414

Goal: Build a stunning, futuristic “AI Booking System” demo that looks alive — as if the Vapi agent is performing real booking operations and logging each one into the dashboard.

Core Functionalities:

When a booking occurs (simulated or test input), automatically log:

Client name

Date and time of booking

Service type (AI Consultation, Automation Setup, etc.)

Booking status (Confirmed / Rescheduled / Canceled)

Store these logs locally (JSON or localStorage).

Display them beautifully in a minimal dashboard UI.

Include an input field to simulate a new booking (e.g. “Book for John at 4 PM tomorrow”) — the system parses it and adds it to logs.

Add a “Play Demo Voice” button that opens the Vapi assistant demo in a popup or new tab.

Visual / Design Instructions:

Clean, elegant, professional — Achroweb x Agentic AI aesthetic.

Use a dark futuristic UI with neon-blue and glassy tones.

Branding header:

Achroweb Solutions — Agentic Booking Intelligence
“Turning Conversations into Confirmations.”


Responsive and mobile-friendly.

Include subtle AI motion effects (pulsing lights, gradient animations, etc.)

Technical Requirements:

Stack: HTML + CSS + JavaScript (React optional).

Save bookings locally for demo purposes.

All actions happen on the front-end — no backend required.

Simulate Vapi responses visually (e.g. “Booking confirmed for Sean tomorrow at 3 PM”).

Optional Enhancements (if time permits):

Add “Voice Logs” tab showing recent conversations or mock transcriptions.

Include a live timestamp on the dashboard.

Add Achroweb logo animation or intro fade effect.

Final Note:

This demo is meant to impress investors and clients like Andy, showing the Achroweb voice AI integrated into an autonomous system. Make it feel premium, intelligent, and alive — like a system from the future.
